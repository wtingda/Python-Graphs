# Python Data Structures
HashMaps, LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Trees, Graphs, Sorts, you name it - all in Python. Written for practice.

## Sorts
Sorting algorithms such as Heapsort, Quicksort(in-place as well as one-liner implementation), Mergesort, etc. Just don't try Bogosort...

## HashMap, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Heap (PriorityQueue)
Various useful data structures reimplemented in python.

## Binary Search Tree 
Binary Search, insert, deletion, in-order traversal, BST checking. TODO: balancing, various traversals

## Graph
Just a graph implementation in Python to make Djikstra happy. With weights, direction, and shortest-path finding.
